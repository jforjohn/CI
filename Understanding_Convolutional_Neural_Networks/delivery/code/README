To execute our code some requirements must be installed:

- Lasagne. Requires updated theano version, scipy and numpy
	- pip instal rheano
	- pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lasagne/Lasagne/v0.1/requirements.txt
	- pip install numpy
	- pip install scipy
- cPickle package:
	- pip install cPickle
- tarfile and zipfile packages.

Python 2.7 has been used.

Execution instructions:

The main architecture of the network contains two convolutional layers followed
by max pool layers and local normalization layers across maps. Then,
it is followed by a hidden layer and a softmax output layer. The main parameters
to tune are included in conf.properties. Modify that file in order to
change some of the parameters. If some deeper parameter modification is needed
browse into the code.

Then, execute:

> python cifar.py
